To the best of my knowledge, everything has been implemented correctly.

Discussed the lab with Jason Fan.

This lab took approximately 1.5 hours to complete.

No, you cannot request data from a different origin or from your local machine using XMLHttpRequest. This same-origin policy is for security reasons, as it prevents anyone gaining access to sensitive data through a web page's DOM. Without the same-origin policy of XMLHttpRequest, malicious sources can gain access to private contents of a website by analysing and manipulating the HTML DOM, and security is breached.
