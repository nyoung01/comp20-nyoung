Assignment 2: The Real Marauder's Map
Started: 3.8.15
README

To the best of my knowledge, everything has been implemented correctly.
	I retreive my location using navigator.geolocation, render a map centered on my location, send my data to the correct datastore API, retreive information of other's whereabouts in that datastore, and parse through the JSON, creating a marker for each login, with an infowindow that displays their login and their distance in miles away from my location.

I discussed this project with Jason Fan and Thomas Schaffner.

Approximately 4 hours were spent finishing this assignment.
